Introduction
============

*Our goal : write clear, readeable, high-level and yet efficient programs.*

This is the motto of the lectures.
Traditionnally, it is often said that genericity, abstraction (i.e. high-level) programming 
is not compatible with the efficency that we need in scientific computations.
The goal of these lectures is to show that we can achieve these goals with today C++ and libraries.

Why is it important?
--------------------

* Our codes are changing all the times. We want to have code reuse.

* more to come here


Goal of the lectures
--------------------

* Present some patterns and techniques which are useful to write high level and efficient codes.
* Fix the "pattern" design of TRIQS. One problem : one standardised solution.
