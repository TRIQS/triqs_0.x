Notes for TRIQS C++ contributor
*********************************

  *Our goal : write clear, readeable, high-level and yet efficient programs.*

The goal of these notes is to be :

* a starting point for learning modern C++ for scientific computation :
  Traditionnally, it is often said that genericity, abstraction (i.e. high-level) programming 
  is not compatible with the efficency that we need in scientific computations.
  The goal of these lectures is to show that we can achieve these goals with today C++ and libraries.

* a style guide for the TRIQS project (C++ part).

Most of the content is more general (and independant of the TRIQS project).
They are a few notes on modern C++ for scientific computations.

The intended audience is physicists with a basic knowledge of C++ (??).
These lectures do not focuss on basic syntax, but on useful **idioms**.
