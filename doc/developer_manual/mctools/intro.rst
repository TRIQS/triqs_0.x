The Monte Carlo class
=====================

The TRIQS library has a class called ``mc_generic`` which allows you to write
Monte Carlo algorithms in a simple framework. The class takes care of the basic
mechanics which is common to any Monte Carlo method so that you can focus on
the implementation details of your specific algorithm.
