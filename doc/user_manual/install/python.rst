Python and the scientific python tools
====================================================

On some machines, not all the necessary scientific python tools are present
(e.g. old distribution, computation centers, etc....), or not in the right version.

There are two ways to efficiently solve this issue (other than recompiling your own python, and 
all the libs, which is painful) and specially **avoiding any upgrade on your system** (which 
is crucial on cluster machines e.g.).
