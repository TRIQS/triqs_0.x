Getting started
====================

* After the installation, provided that the tests have passed successfully, 
  TRIQS has been installed using the standard UNIX scheme:

   * executables in :file:`path_to_install_directory/bin`.

   * python modules in :file:`path_to_install_directory/lib/pytriqs`.
 
   * documentation in :file:`path_to_install_directory/share`.

   * C++ libraries in :file:`path_to_install_directory/include` and :file:`path_to_install_directory/lib/triqs`.

* Add ``path_to_install_directory/bin`` to your path...

* Just launch ::

   ipytriqs my_script.py

  Or to get the notebook ::

   ipytriqs_notebook 


* You can now proceed to the tutorial ....
