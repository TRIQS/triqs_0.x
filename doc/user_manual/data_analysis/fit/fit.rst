Fitting data
====================

A simple example 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let us for example fit the Green function :


.. plot:: data_analysis/fit/fit_test.py
   :include-source:
   :scale: 70

Note that `x_window` appears in the `x_data_view` method to clip the data on a given window
and in the plot function, to clip the plot itself. 

A more complex example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To illustrate the use of python in a more complex situation, 
let us demonstrate a simple data analysis.
This does not show any more TRIQS object, it is just a little exercise in python...

Imagine that we have 10 Green function coming from a calculation in a hdf5 file.
For the need of the demonstration, we will create them "manually" here, but it is just to make life easier.

  

Reference 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Fit class is very simple and is provided for convenience, but the reader
is encouraged to read it and adapt it (it is simply a call to scipy.leastsq).

.. autoclass:: pytriqs.fit.Fit
  :members: 


Example of fitfunc:: 
         
  linear    =  lambda X, a,b   : a * X + b,             r"$%f x + %f$"          , (1,1) 
  quadratic =  lambda X, a,b,c : (a * X + b)*Omega + c, r"$%f x^2 + %f x + %f$" , (0,1,1)
